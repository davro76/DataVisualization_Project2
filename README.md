# DataVisualization_Project2

## Instructions:
1. This is a group project so you are going to be working with one of your classmates.
2. Select a dataset or database of your choice. I would advise to use the dataset you already chose for Project #1, but you have to make that decision.
3. Email the instructor the dataset or database you chose for this project. If possible, include in your email the exploratory data analysis steps with a brief description (metadata) of the fields you are using for this activity. 
4. Create a two-page report  using the knowledge you acquired during the first 8 Chapters of this course.
5. Create a dashboard and share it. Explain how the data can be refreshed in your report(in case it can be refreshed).
6. You must discuss your research question or the problem to address in this project. What made you use this dataset in particular? What are you findings? What are your thoughts and next steps about this problem in particular?
7. Why would a manager, a city or county in the United States, a stakeholders group, or a consulting company would be interested in your project?
8. What does successful completion of this project add to your data analysis professional portfolio?
9. This project must be presented during the last week of classes. I recommend presenting on Monday because then you can focus on exam 2. Notify the instructor which day you prefer to present.
10. You must have ready a power point (or word document) and a power bi file for the presentation. Submit both via Blackboard as a zip file.
11. Even though this is a group project, every student is responsible for submitting Project 2 individually. Submission of the end result of this project is the best proof that this was a group effort.
